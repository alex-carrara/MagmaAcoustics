# MagmaAcoustics

This function computes the velocity of a P wave and the associated intrinsic attenuation coefficient in magma as a function of the physical properties of its constituents, and the frequency of the wave. 

The function is available for Matlab/Octave.
An alpÄ¥a version of the solver for python is available
